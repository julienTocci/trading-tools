Twitter API -> AWS Kinesis -> Aws S3 -> SpaCy-> Backend -> Fabric

Now everything is setup:
You can create a Kinesis stream to follow some users and track only specific terms :
python3 createdatasource.py keyword1-keyword2 followUserId1 followUserId2

Get user Id you want to follow and put it in stream.filter(follow=)

Tests (https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/filter-realtime/guides/basic-stream-parameters
):
- Putting track and followed show all tweet from anyone which contains track (doesn't seems to take into account follow)
- Putting only follow=['UserId'] permits to follow twitter from users (will get all tweets from the users?)
