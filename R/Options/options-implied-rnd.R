# Trading in options with a wide range of exercise prices and a single maturity allows 
# a researcher to extract the market's risk-neutral density (RND) over the underlying price at expiration.
# The RND: (risk neutral density) contains investorsâ€™ beliefs about the true probabilities blended with their risk 
#preferences, both of which are of great interest to academics and practitioners alike


# I Printed a document talking about  one's expectations to the true value of RND

### You should see that all methods extract the same density!

#### First let's calculate the theorical price of options in the range 200-400 ####

# current aapl volatility
sigma = 0.99
# AAPL risk-free rate is 0,92%
r = 0.092
# dividend yield of AAPL
y = 0.01
# 5 DTE 
te = 5/365
# current price of AAPL
s0 = 229.24
# Strike price of the call
k = 250.00	

# Estimates using black & scholes

call.strikes.bsm = seq(from = 200, to = 400, by = 5)
market.calls.bsm = price.bsm.option(r =r, te = te, s0 = s0,
                                    k = call.strikes.bsm, sigma = sigma, y = y)$call
put.strikes.bsm = seq(from = 200, to = 400, by = 5)
market.puts.bsm = price.bsm.option(r =r, te = te, s0 = s0,
                                   k = put.strikes.bsm, sigma = sigma, y = y)$put


# IV for a specific call price
IV = AmericanOptionImpliedVolatility(type="call", value=3.70, underlying=s0,
                                     strike=k, dividendYield=y, riskFreeRate=r,
                                     maturity=te, volatility=sigma)

# IV = 99%

k = 200
# IV for a specific call price
IV = AmericanOptionImpliedVolatility(type="call", value=33, underlying=s0,
                                     strike=k, dividendYield=y, riskFreeRate=r,
                                     maturity=te, volatility=sigma)

# IV = 134%: indeed the premium is very high and indicates that the stock needs consequential movement in order to be ITM


#market.puts.bsm and market.calls.bsm should output the estimated price for every strike price in range 200-400
